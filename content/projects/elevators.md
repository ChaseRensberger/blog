Recently, two of the three elevators on the east side of my apartment building have stopped working. This means that going home to my apartment is often met with a ten minute wait for an elevator that is packed so full of people, it would make (insert pun here). Contrast this with the west side of the building where there are 5 working elevators, all operating in perfect harmony.

This experience has got me thinking a lot about the elevator algorithm. I want to dive deep into how it works and the nuances to its complexity that are often under considered, after all how tough could it be to pick someone up at a floor and take them to where they want to go.

There is a fantastic game where you can expiriment with your own elevator algorithm.

The first thing to note is that there does not exist just one elevator algorithm. For example, in many skyscrapers elevators are often limited to a range of floors with certain elevators locked to only serve certain floors.

It is clear that elevators
